const title = 'Santiago Calvo. Full Stack developer.';
const description = `
I am a computer engineering student and FullStack developer currently working at eagerWorks as a Team Leader.
As a Team Leader, I organize and build positive rapport, inspire trust, and guide teams toward achieving organizational goals.

As a FullStack developer, I am eager to learn the tools necessary for the job. Even though I am opinionated about tech, I will always take the project's necessities first and look for the solution that best fits the product based on the current priorities and future opportunities.
