      `I started working at Eagerworks in 2019 as a Jr Fullstack developer. My time was spent learning and building products for startups. I have a very proactive personality, so very early in my career, I started conversing with clients and making technical decisions for the product.`,
      `Started with small projects of one-person teams and incrementally larger teams, from one to two, from two to three, and then the largest team, five. Most of them with a leadership role.`,
      `I have now also started working on a project manager and technical leader role helping the founders transition to a manager role for more high-level responsibilities. At the same time, I take care of projects, technical difficulties, and decisions on the stack that the company will use in the future, primarily focused on frontend and full-stack projects.
